# Bitcoin Address Ops :zap: 

The aim of this is to learn everything about Bitcoin keys and addresses. This includes the following:

## Step 1 :zap:
- generate a private key and present it in the various formates (hex, WIF, WIF compressed)
- derive the public key from the above in the correct format
- derive addresses from the above


## Step 2 :zap:
- reproduce the behaviour of an HD wallet
- random mnemonic words -> seed -> HD tree things
